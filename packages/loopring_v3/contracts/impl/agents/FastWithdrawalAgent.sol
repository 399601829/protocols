/// @title Fast withdrawal agent implementation.
///
///        A mediator/liquidity provider (whoever provides the funds immediately) can call
///        `executeFastWithdrawals` to provide users immediately with funds onchain.
///        This allows the security of the funds to be handled by any EOA or smart contract.
///
///        Users that want to make use of this functionality have to
///        authorize this contract as their agent.
///
///        TODO: generalize this (here or another agent) with any function call
///        a user wants to do to be able to simulate completely onchain smart wallet with
///        funds stored in the Loopring protocol.
